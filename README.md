# Customer Propensity Modelling
There are many visitors to websites every day, some purchase but many do not. The business spend money re-targeting past visitors, and the might like to optimise this activity by targeting the visitors who are more likely to convert. To do this, I have taken data showing which parts of the website users interacted with.
The questions are:
Which of these interactiuons effect a users likelihood to purchase?
Can we score visitors from yesterday who did not purchase, to see who the most valueable prospects are?

This heatmap shows the correlation between the columns in the dataset and we are going to pay more attention to the ordered column and its correlation with other columns
