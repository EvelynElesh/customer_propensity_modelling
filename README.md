# Customer Propensity Modelling
There are many visitors to websites every day, some purchase but many do not. The business spend money re-targeting past visitors, and the might like to optimise this activity by targeting the visitors who are more likely to convert. To do this, I have taken data showing which parts of the website users interacted with.
The questions are:
Which of these interactiuons effect a users likelihood to purchase?
Can we score visitors from yesterday who did not purchase, to see who the most valueable prospects are?
